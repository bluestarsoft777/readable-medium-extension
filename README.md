# Readable Medium extension

This is a Chrome extension which will remove Medium's large header and footer to make the content more readable. The script is very lightweight and shouldn't add too much overhead to the application

You can install it from [Chrome web store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/readable-mediumcom/jiopenehkeajnaibdidoaaecammkdooo)

## Getting Started

If you want to try it locally, just clone the project, add changes to the scripts in src/
and run `npm run build` to build the extension.

## Built With

* [Parcel](https://parceljs.org/) - For build process
* [headroom.js](https://github.com/WickyNilliams/headroom.js) - To hide the header/footer when scrolling
* [zip-folder](https://github.com/sole/node-zip-folder) - To zip the built extension for easier deploys
